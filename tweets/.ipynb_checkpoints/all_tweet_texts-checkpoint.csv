2020-01-22-18,"#China's coronavirus has 'the same death rate as the #Spanish flu pandemic that killed 50m people in 1918'

“This 2019-nCoV’s death rate is around 2%, similar to Spanish flu,” Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said.
https://t.co/Iqa5fU2kTl"
2020-01-22-18,"Chinese officials have confirmed 440 cases of the new coronavirus strain - 2019-nCoV - so far, with 17 deaths.

Based on existing data, it is said to have a 2% death rate.

This means that for every 50 people who catch the infection, one will statistically die."
2020-01-22-18,"To put this into context, around one in every 1,000 who develop flu die, giving it a death rate of 0.1%.

“This 2019-nCoV’s death rate could be 2%, similar to Spanish flu,” Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said."
2020-01-22-18,"2019-nCoV is thought to have originated in animals before “jumping” over to humans.
